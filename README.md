# N Re-fixation efficiency
This code calculates the re-fixation efficiency of liable sedimentary N by meta-igneous altered oceanic crust inside subduction zones. The code has been used in Li, K., Li, G.-Y., Du, Y., Han, W., Zhang, J., Chen, L., Zhou, J.-B., Li, L. (2021). Intraslab remobilization of nitrogen during early subduction facilitates deep nitrogen recycling: Insights from the blueschists in the Heilongjiang Complex in NE China. Chemical Geology, 120474.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2021.120474. If you find that the code is useful for your purpose, please cite the paper and use the code as you want.
